Hi, my name is Darius and I'm currently a senior undergraduate student
at UIC pursuing a B.S. in computer science. I also recently completed an
internship at the [Open Networking
Foundation](https://opennetworking.org/), where I contributed to the
[SD-Fabric](https://opennetworking.org/sd-fabric/) project by designing
and implementing two new fully-automated line-rate test infrastructures.
The first was for the Intel Tofino switch implementation of SD-Fabric,
and the second was for a userspace software UPF built on
[BESS](https://github.com/NetSys/bess).

I was also a research assistant to Professor [Brent
Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/).  With Professor Stephens, I
worked on data center networking issues relating to in-network
computing, TCP, ECN congestion and programmable hardware.
